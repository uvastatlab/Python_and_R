See this TBD section. 1.2 Assignment Python uses = for assignment while R can use either = or &lt;- for assignment. The latter assignment arrow is preferred in most R style guides to distinguish it between assignment and setting the value of a function argument. According to Rs documentation, The operator &lt;- can be used anywhere, whereas the operator = is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt) or as one of the subexpressions in a braced list of expressions.
