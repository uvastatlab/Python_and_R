Python &gt; 3**2 9 &gt; 5 // 2 2 &gt; 5 % 2 1 R &gt; 3^2 [1] 9 &gt; 5 %/% 2 [1] 2 &gt; 5 %% 2 [1] 1 In Python, the + operator can also be used to combine strings. See this TBD section. 1.2 Assignment Python uses = for assignment while R can use either = or &lt;- for assignment. The latter “assignment arrow” is preferred in most R style guides to distinguish it between assignment and setting the value of a function argument. According to R’s documentation, “The operator &lt;- can be used anywhere, whereas the operator = is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt) or as one of the subexpressions in a braced list of expressions.” See ?assignOps. Python &gt; x = 12 R &gt; x &lt;- 12 1.3 Printing a value To see the value of an object created via assignment, you can simply enter the object at the console and hit enter for both Python and R, though it is common in Python to explicitly use the print function. Python &gt; x 12 R &gt; x [1] 12 1.4 Generating a sequence of values There are multiple ways in both Python and R to generate sequences of values. In Python, one option is arange() from numpy. In R, a common approach is to use seq(). The sequences can be incremented by indicating a step argument in arange() or a by argument in seq(). Be aware that the start/stop interval in arange() is open, but the from/to interval in seq() is closed. Python &gt; import numpy as np + x = np.arange(start = 1, stop = 11, step = 2) + x array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) R &gt; x &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 11, by = 2) &gt; x [1] 1 3 5 7 9 11 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
