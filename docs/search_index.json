See this TBD section. 1.2 Assignment Python uses = for assignment while R can use either = or &lt;- for assignment. The latter assignment arrow is preferred in most R style guides to distinguish it between assignment and setting the value of a function argument. According to Rs documentation, The operator &lt;- can be used anywhere, whereas the operator = is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt) or as one of the subexpressions in a braced list of expressions. See ?assignOps.

Python &gt; x 12 R &gt; x [1] 12 1.4 Generating a sequence of values There are multiple ways in both Python and R to generate sequences of values. In Python, one option is arange() from numpy. In R, a common approach is to use seq(). The sequences can be incremented by indicating a step argument in arange() or a by argument in seq(). Be aware that the start/stop interval in arange() is open, but the from/to interval in seq() is closed. Python &gt; import numpy as np + x = np.arange(start = 1, stop = 11, step = 2) + x array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) R &gt; x &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 11, by = 2) &gt; x [1] 1 3 5 7 9 11 "],["importing-data.html", "Chapter 2 Importing Data 2.1 CSV", " Chapter 2 Importing Data This chapter reviews importing external data into Python and R, including CSV, txt, and other structured data files. 2.1 CSV Comma separated value (CSV) files are text files with fields separated by commas. They are useful for rectangular data where rows represent observations and columns represent variables or features. Python &gt; import pandas + d = pandas.read_csv(&#39;data/dat.csv&#39;) R There are many ways to import a csv file.
